# Tetromino Ghost Smasher
Top down wall shooter game for Ludum Dare 42. Didn't manage to finish it, so it's glitchy and has no sound, but it's [playable over here](https://alcex.itch.io/tetromino-ghost-smasher)!

*You're being chased by ghosts! Thankfully, you have your trusty Tetromino Shooter which you can use to smash the enemies into the walls but careful! If you shoot carelessly you'll run out of space to run, and if a ghosts catches you, it's insta-death!*
